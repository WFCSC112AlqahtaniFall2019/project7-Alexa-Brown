I chose the data set about the World Happiness Report because I love to see the countries to are happy and the factors that
might play into this. I thought it was very interesting to see a lot of European countries highly ranked in happiness, with
many African countries ranked lower. I try to be a very positive person, trying to find the good and happy things in life so
I was excited when I found this data set because I could see the other countries that are trying to do something similar.
This data set shows the country name, the happiness rank, the happiness score, and the GDP of these countries. The higher the
score, the higher the rank because there are less things that have a negative impact on the country's happiness and more things
that increase the country's happiness. Another interesting thing is that the GDP was usually higher for the countries which were
ranked higher. This data set was very interesting to work with and I'm excited to see more data sets similar to it.
